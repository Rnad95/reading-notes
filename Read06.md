# Interfaces and Inheritance

## Introduction

---

- Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is built to describe a real-world object.  

- we create an object from the Class which is the blueprint.

## Class

---
Classes contains Attributes Like the balance in bank account example and methods like deposit money.

## Generalization

---
Generalization aims to:  

- reduce the complexity  
- reduce the redundancy  
- increasing the organization  

The Generalization includes Interface and Inheritance

## Inheritance  

---
It allows creating a subclass that extends its functionality

Inheritance has Superclass (Parent) and subClass (Child).  

## Interface

---
It describe generic behavior which subclass have to follow whenever leave the implementations details to them.

- Interface is a special case from the inheritance when two classes have only common behavior.
