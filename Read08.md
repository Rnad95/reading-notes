## Important Principle in OOP

---

- **Don't Repeat Yourself** (DRY) principle is created to reduce the redundancy in the code in software development and this it will be using the abstraction and interface.  

>The reason for DRY is that repeated code is bad practice because if we need to modify something it will be harder to fix all the related methods.  

>Unlike the WET which stands for Write Everything Twice
The opposing view to DRY is called WET. Another face to Abstraction is the **Avoid Hasty Abstraction (AHA)**

- **Rule of three** states that two instances of similar code do not require to build new procedure but in third time, it should be extracted into a new procedure

- **You aren't gonna need it (YAGNI)** which is a principle that consider that we add the functionality  if only is necessary to add.

**A minimum viable product (MVP)** is created to interact with the current time and can be edited in the future. and it used for the lack of the Features when the result is not expected to success.

### The aims to MVP is

1. Be able to test a product hypothesis with minimal resources
2. Accelerate learning
3. Reduce wasted engineering hours
4. Get the product to early customers as soon as possible
5. Base for other products
6. To establish a builder's abilities in crafting the product required
7. Brand building very quickly.
