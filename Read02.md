## Loops

*Definition:* Repeating statement(s) N times if the condition is true.  

> ## Type of Loops  

There are four main types in java:

1. The Simple for Loop which has a counter, condition, and increment/decrement.

2. While Loop with a condition. We used this type when we don't know where we have to stop.  

3. Do-While Loop is a similar to While loop but we go through the loop at least one time.  

4. for-each: Enhancement loop to through Array.

## Package

*Definition:* A set of Classes gathering together in one place called package. The package looks like a directory in our local machine, And we need to import them in the top of the page of our code.  

> ## Package Declaration  

- > `Import` javaPackage.subPackage.Classes;  
  > Or import all subPackage using `*`  
  > `Import` javaPackage.subPackage.* ;  

> ## Some Packages in java

There are many packages in Java 5. The most Package is used in java is `java.util`

***&nbsp;NOTE:**  

1. `java.lang` can be used without import that package.

2. The programmers should be import the package and classes that want only compiler to look for them.
