## GitHub’s Guide to Open Source

If you have never contributed to an open source project before and you’re just getting started, consider exploring these resources.

First contributions is a hands-on tutorial that walks you through contributions workflow on GitHub. When you complete the tutorial, you have made a contribution to the same project.

[up-for-grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net) is a site that aggregates (rolls up and makes easy to explore) projects that actively want help. They label those projects with things like “up-for-grabs”, “jump-in” or “help wanted.”

goodfirstissues.com is a site that aggregates the latest issues with the label “Good First Issue”, which is a GitHub feature for finding easy issues to tackle. 

goodfirstissues.com empowers first-time contributors to find and select issues that they want to solve.

goodfirstissue.dev curates easy pickings from popular open-source projects, and helps you make your first contribution to open-source.

CodeTriage helps you subscribe to your favorite open-source projects and get a new open issue from them in your inbox every day.

Read blog posts and guides on how to contribute to an open source project, then pick one!

## What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to Open-Source Software?

---

1. Improve Coding Skills
2. Gain Early Experience
3. Increase Community and Peer Recognition
4. Greater Job Prospects
5. Improve Software on a User and Business Level.

**Why should I contribute to open-source?**

Ever wonder if all these projects/software were single-handedly maintained by a single developer?
What would have been its impact on them and pretty much on us?

The software would not have had so many features and upgradations. This is where open source contribution comes in. Contributors from around the world help develop and improve the software for every one of us who use it. Being a contributor will give you the super-power to be a part of something that is impacting so many lives.

Apart from the impact that you get to create, it also helps you become a better developer and with time a good mentor, leader, and passionate team player.

## How to make a clean pull request

---
Look for a project's contribution instructions. If there are any, follow them.

Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called origin.
Add the original repository as a remote called upstream.
If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
Create a new branch to work on! Branch from develop if it exists, else from master.
Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
If the project has tests run them!
Write or adapt tests as needed.
Add or change the documentation as needed.
Squash your commits into a single commit with git's interactive rebase. Create a new branch if necessary.
Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.
From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's develop branch if there is one, else go for master!
...
Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).
And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code – not what you did to the code.
